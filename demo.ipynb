    "# Late Binding Closures\n",
    "\n",
    "A closure in Python is a function object that has access to variables from its enclosing lexical scope, even when the function is called outside that scope. These variables are \"closed over\" by the closure, which is why it's called a \"closure\". Closures \"remember\" the values of these variables, even if they no longer exist in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"late binding\" refers to the time at which a variable name is looked up to find the variable's actual value. In Python, this lookup happens when the variable is used (i.e., when the closure is called), not when the function is defined - hence it's \"late\". This is why closures in Python capture the variables themselves, not their values at the time the function is defined."

This function's goal is to make the image a bit blurry, but what happens is the image becomes totally blurry. This small image-changing function shows how forgetting about late bindings in closures can create big issues. Often, we realize these issues when it's already too late to fix them easily."
